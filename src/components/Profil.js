        <p>
        I am of Franco-Portuguese origin, passionate about travel, music and sneakers.<br />
        I work for a long time in the catering and event sectors.<br />
        My natural dynamic, motivated and curious are assets to help me meet all challenges and particularly new experiences like this one.<br />
        I like to work in a team and take up challenges but also know how to be autonomous.<br />
        I can't wait to join a new team!
